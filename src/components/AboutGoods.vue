        <p class="my-4 dark:text-text-color">
          WINE WINE is a signature store of Bayadera. Therefore, my product is a licensed beverage officially imported to Ukraine.
        </p>
        <p class="dark:text-text-color">Long known: many of my brands are already well known and sold in Ukrainian supermarkets for a long time (Hennessy, Jagermeister, Baileys, Latinium, Don Simon and others). Bayadera Group brought them to Ukraine before, and now Bayadera also sells them through its store-warehouse.</p>
        <p class="my-4 dark:text-text-color">
          Narrow profile: some wines were previously sold only by restaurants and specialized liquor stores (Domini Veneti, El Coto, Roland Lavantureux, etc.).
        </p>
        <p class="dark:text-text-color">New: I brought something specially for WINE WINE stores (100-ball according to Parker, orange and natural wines, world brands such as Castel or Accolade).</p>

        <p class="my-4 dark:text-text-color ">
          I am proud of every bottle I brought, even if it costs 100 hryvnias, because every bottle is a worthy sample in its weight category.
        </p>
        <p class="dark:text-text-color">You can buy table wine from me: a simple but pleasant wine for the evening. You can buy good wine from me - rare, expensive, collectible, as well as elite alcohol, which is bought for gifts and tastings.</p>
        <p class="my-4 dark:text-text-color">
          I have different wines of the world, but the Vine Vine assortment is deliberately not too wide. It is verified and reliable. Also, it is updated frequently.
        </p>
        <p class="dark:text-text-color">I agree, it is not difficult to buy good wine in a store today. It is difficult to find such a good price as mine ðŸ™‚</p>
